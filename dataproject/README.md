# Data analysis project

Our project is titled **Dataproject of the employmentrate in the danish municipalities** and is about cleaning af presenting a simple data analysis.
As can be seen in the  [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb) together with the [dataproject.py](dataproject.py) we start by cleaning and merging 6 different datasets on the danish municipalities from Denmarks statitics. Then the data is presented through numerous different graphs. 

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the following installations:
numpy as np
matplotlib.pyplot as plt
pandas as pd
import pydst as pydst
