    "In this project we will analyze the traditionel Cournot model, known from lectures at the Micro 1,2 and 3. In a Cournot the firms competes in quantities thereby choosing the quantites taken into account the best response of the other firms to that quantity. Firstly, we will present the settings of the model followed by a analytic solution. Then we will simplify the settings and analyze a numerical case and examine how the numerical case is affected by the number of firms."
