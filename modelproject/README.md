# Model analysis project

Our project is titled **Modelproject of the Cournot model** and is about the Cournot model with symmetric and unsymmetric costfunctions known from Micro 1,2 and 3. Furthermore the project will examine the equilibrium for different number of firms competing in the market. As can be seen in the modelproject.ipynb together with the modelproject.py we start by setting up a case with 2 firms and assymetric cost functions. Then heading for a more general case. 

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb).

The functions generating the **results** in the *Analytical oSlution* and the *Numerical Solution* sections can be seen in the [modelproject.ipy](modelproject.ipy).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the following imports: numpy as np , matplotlib.pyplot as plt ,  scipy as sp , sympy as sm , ipywidgets as widgets  and pylab
