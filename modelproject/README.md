# Model analysis project

Our project is titled **Modelproject of the Cournot model** and is about the Cournot model with symmetric and unsymmetric costfunctions known from Micro 1,2 and 3. Furthermore the project will examine the equilibrium for different number of firms competing in the market. As can be seen in the modelproject.ipynb together with the modelproject.py we start by setting up a numerical case with 2 firms and assymetric cost functions. Then heading for a analytical case using functions to generate general results. In the end of the project we examine an numerical interactive case, where the reader can choose values of own choice to analyze quantities corresponding to perfect competition and monopolistic competition.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb).

The functions generating the **results** in the *Analytical Solution* and the *Numerical Solution* sections can be seen in the [modelproject.ipy](modelproject.ipy).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the following imports: numpy as np , matplotlib.pyplot as plt ,  scipy as sp , sympy as sm , ipywidgets as widgets  and pylab
