# Inaugural project

This project is about solving a traditional consumer problem.
As can be seen in the  [inauguralproject.ipynb](inauguralproject.ipynb) together with the [inauguralproject.py](inauguralproject.py) we start by finding the optimal levels of labor supply and consumption. Then, based on these values we determine the tax revenue and optimal taxrates.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [inauguralproject.ipynb](inauguralproject.ipynb).

The functions generating the **results** can be seen in the [inauguralproject.py](inauguralproject.py)

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
